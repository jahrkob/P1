# P1

This repository contains our group's COMTEK P1 project "Programming and System Development".

## Project Structure

- **PSC_attack/** - Original Arduino-based Power Side-Channel attack demonstration
- **PSC_attack_nordic/** - Nordic Semiconductor (nRF52 series) version with BLE capabilities

## Hardware Platforms

### Arduino
The original `PSC_attack` folder contains code for standard Arduino boards (Uno, Nano, etc.).

### Nordic Semiconductor
The `PSC_attack_nordic` folder contains optimized code for Nordic nRF52 series microcontrollers:
- nRF52832 (Bluetooth 5.0)
- nRF52840 (Bluetooth 5.2)
- Compatible development boards (Arduino Nano 33 BLE, Adafruit Feather nRF52840, etc.)

See the README in each folder for specific setup instructions.
